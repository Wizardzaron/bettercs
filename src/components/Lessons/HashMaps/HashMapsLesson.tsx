			<p>
				A HashMap is a data structure that stores key-value pairs. It is
				used to store data in a way that allows for fast retrieval. The
				key is used to look up the value, and the value is the data that
				is stored. The key must be unique, but the value can be
				duplicated.
			</p>
			<p>
				To visualize a HashMap, think of it as a dictionary. The key is
				the word, and the value is the definition. When you look up a
				word in a dictionary, you are using the key to retrieve the
				value.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can drag and drop each key-value pair of the HashMap below!
